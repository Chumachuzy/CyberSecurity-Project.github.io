										<h3>Network Design and Deployment for Erling Stores (Alias)</h3>
										<p>After thorough analysis of the networking challenges at Erling (Alias), we proposed and implemented a scalable solution involving the creation of multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) interconnected into a Wide Area Network (WAN). We collaboratively designed the network architecture, detailing the required devices such as switches, routers, and a central server located at the head office for inventory management accessible across all locatio</p>
										<p>We simulated the network using Cisco Packet Tracer to ensure connectivity and performance before physical deployment. This allowed us to test various network topologies and ensure seamless communication across all LANs. Each device and endpoint was assigned a unique IP address, and routing protocols were configured to enable effective communication between the different store locations.</p>
										<p>The successful implementation of this WAN resolved a major issue for Erling, where stores previously faced challenges in cross-location communication. Our solution also allowed room for future scalability to accommodate additional devices or locations.</p>
										
										<h3>Network Security Implementation</h3>
										<p>To ensure the security of the newly deployed network, we configured a firewall rule using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). This was applied to the system housing the company's sensitive information to block unauthorized access. The firewall rule was designed to protect the critical endpoint by restricting inbound ICMP traffic, effectively mitigating risks in the event of a network breach. This security measure adds an essential layer of protection to safeguard company data while maintaining network functionality.</p>

											<h3>Erling Superstore: Network and Security Overhaul</h3>
											<p>Erling Superstore, a retail chain with multiple locations across a wide geographic region, was facing significant inefficiencies in its inventory management system. The absence of real-time stock data was leading to both overstocking and understocking at different stores, negatively affecting operations. Furthermore, the company’s inadequate security infrastructure posed a risk of data breaches, highlighting the urgent need for a more robust and secure network solution.</p>

											<h3>Network Setup and Firewall Configuration Success</h3>
											<p>After successfully setting up the networks and configuring IP addresses, we were able to resolve Erling’s communication issues across their multiple locations. The above screenshot demonstrates successful pings between two endpoints on separate networks, confirming seamless connectivity.</p>
											<p>Additionally, the image below shows the successful firewall configuration of the endpoint housing Erling’s sensitive data. By using ICMP rules, we ensured that in case of a network compromise, unauthorized access to critical company information is blocked. This solution directly addresses the company’s concerns about securing their network and managing sensitive documents.</p>
